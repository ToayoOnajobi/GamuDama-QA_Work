- Resolution: 1920x1080 

Severity: Major
Priority: Medium
Frequency: Inconsistent 

Steps to reproduce:

2. Play until the level titled "Kuwai Summit"
3. Go on the ice surface and acclerate to the wall on the right of the level until the character is stuck inside. 

Expected Result: 
- The character, Rikshi should not be able to phase through the wall, and should still remain on the screen.

Actual Result: 
- Rikishi gets stuck in between the wall and is unable to escape unless the player aims and shoots towards the map of the level.

Result:
